    "This laboratory is focused on getting more advanced versions of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms up and running. Deep Reinforcement Learning is **hard**, and getting agents to stably train can be frustrating and requires quite a bit of subtlety in analysis of intermediate results. We will start by implementing `REINFORCE` on the [Cartpole environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)."

The car starts at rest in the center of the road, and its goal is to visit as many tiles as it can in the least amount of time possible. The reward is -0.1 every frame and +1000/N for every track tile visited, where N is the total number of tiles visited in the track and 1000 is the maximum number of actions it can take. The episode can also terminate if the car terminates the track or goes outside the playfield, far off the track, in which case it will receive -100 reward and die. For example, if you have finished in 732 frames, your reward is 1000 - 0.1*732 = 926.8 points. \n",
