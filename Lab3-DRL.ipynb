    "This laboratory is focused on getting more advanced versions of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms up and running. Deep Reinforcement Learning is **hard**, and getting agents to stably train can be frustrating and requires quite a bit of subtlety in analysis of intermediate results. We will start by implementing `REINFORCE` on the [Cartpole environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)."
