Deep Reinforcement Learning is **hard**, and getting agents to stably train can be frustrating and requires quite a bit of subtlety in analysis of intermediate results. We will start by implementing `REINFORCE` on the [Cartpole environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)."

Write an implementation (or adapt an existing one) of `Deep Q-Learning` to solve our two environments (Cartpole and Lunar Lander). To do this you will need to implement a **Replay Buffer** and use a second, slow-moving **target Q-Network** to stabilize learning.\n",

This will be the most *fun*, but also the most *difficult*. Some tips:\n",

    "1. Make sure you use the `continuous=False` argument to the environment constructor. This ensures that the action space is **discrete** (we haven't seen how to work with continuous action spaces).\n",
    "2. Your Q-Network will need to be a CNN. A simple one should do, with two convolutional + maxpool layers, folowed by a two dense layers. You will **definitely** want to use a GPU to train your agents.\n",
